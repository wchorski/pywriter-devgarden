## [FreeFileSync](/vault/https://freefilesync.org/)
Open Source, Cross Platform File Synchronization & Backup Software

when I need to make a **One to One** copy of a directory, internally or to another machine via a [SAMBA](/vault/%F0%9F%93%81developer/Home__Lab__%F0%9F%8F%A0/SAMBA.md) share. I originally used this exclusively until I found [Duplicati](/vault/%F0%9F%93%81developer/Home__Lab__%F0%9F%8F%A0/Duplicati.md)

> check out how I sync my iTunes playlists with my [Jellyfin](/vault/%F0%9F%93%81developer/Home__Lab__%F0%9F%8F%A0/Jellyfin.md) server

## setup
- run the sync script manually once you point directories
- you can either fire off the sync script via a **Windows Schedule** or **Bash Script** 
- use their [RealTimeSync](/vault/https://freefilesync.org/manual.php?topic=realtimesync) version if you need something that **watches** a directory 

### connections

- [Jellyfin](/vault/%F0%9F%93%81developer/Home__Lab__%F0%9F%8F%A0/Jellyfin.md)
